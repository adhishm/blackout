Black-out

Program for playing the game of Black-out.

The game is a simple puzzle game in which you have to flip pieces around on a square checkered board until all the pieces have the same side facing up.

The development files for this game are the following:

    tools.h, tools.cpp
    board.h, board.cpp
    blackout.h, blackout.cpp

The files gameManager.h and gameManager.cpp are what their name suggests: the game manager. This is a terminal-based game manager.

If you are interested in forking the repository and creating your own game manager, one with a GUI perhaps, you should take the development files and build your game manager around them.
